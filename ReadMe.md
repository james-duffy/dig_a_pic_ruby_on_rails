#Project 2

Dig-A-Pic is a web app that provides Photographers the ability to sell licenses to their digital photography through an open marketplace. The site allows the public to explore all art on the site and browse by category. Once signed in, users have dual capability to both purchase digital copies of Photography, as well as upload their own work to sell. 

Payment is handled through Balanced and image uploads are handled through Uploadcare.
